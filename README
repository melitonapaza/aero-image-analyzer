This code is intended for the UVic AERO project. They were 
quickly hacked together from OpenCV tutorials to identify 
a predefined set of geometric shapes, QR codes, and vehicles
for an autonomous aerial vehicle.

While this sentence resides, this code is messy and should not be used for anything else.

Warning: None of these demos will work in the field unless we built a 
decent training dataset. That should be done as soon as possible. The 
competition is mere months away. 

To run the demos:
1. install OpenCV, using [1] but substituting steps #1-3 of [2] for step #2 of [1].
2. Run:
	cd demo-truck;
	./detectofplanarobjects ./truck_cropped.jpg ./truck_in_field.jpg
	cd ..;
	cd demo-circle-square;
	./aero-image-analyzer ./shapes.jpg
	cd ..;
3. Review the source code, and get an idea of how to interact with these functions
in OpenCV. They are quick, dirty, and with an appropriate training dataset to
figure out reasonable parameters, they might even do the job AERO needs them to.
If not, there's always more science-maigc in the OpenCV toolkit to scavenge from.
